## 1. Merges the 'training' and the 'test' data sets to create one data set.
    ## 1.a. 
    ## Column-bind activity (y-train/test.txt data), subject
    ## (subject_train/test.txt data) and measurements (X_train/test.txt data).




    ## 1.b.
    ## Row-bind resulting test and train data.




## 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## This has been restricted to 66 measurements that form mean and standard deviation pairs.



## 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the 6 activities
## (e.g. 1:WALKING, 2:WALKING_UPSTAIRS, etc ) in the data set.



## 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
## (e.g. tBodyAccMeanX, tBodyAccStdX).



## 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
## with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
## The data has been arranged to give 'activity' primacy as is suggested with
## the wording in this step.
